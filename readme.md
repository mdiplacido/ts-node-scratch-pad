* ts-node scratch pad optimized for VS Code
* You can write and debug code using the VS Code launch action "Current TS File" without need to explicitly transpile your TypeScript code to JavaScript thanks to ts-node
* you can easily launch the ts-node repl using the npm script 'repl' eg. npm run repl this also works in VS Code
